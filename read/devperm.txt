ok so when makeing a dev command
when you wright the name part 
make it 
~name
not just name

and after 

module.exports.run = async (bot, message, args) => {

that part maked the bot send the message 

after that part put this

  if(!bot.devPerms.includes(message.author.id)) return message.reply("You are not a dev!")

this is what makes command know you a dev 
so if you go to config.json
you devPerms if your id is in there the bot 
thinks you are a dev and will send the message

when making fhe file please use a : to represent a dec command

if you have any more questions dm 
me

btw if there are anymore .txt in here please read them
